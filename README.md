# Awesome DeepSeek Harness [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of **plugins, skills, MCP servers, patch/profile layers, orchestrators, aggregators & UIs** for **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)** — DeepSeek's official agent runtime built around the idea **`Model + Harness = Agent`**.

**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

DeepSeek Harness ("DSH") is DeepSeek's agent runtime / harness layer — the "hands" that turn the model's reasoning into real actions (context management, tool-call orchestration, execution sandbox, feedback loop, session persistence). Its defining feature is an **open plugin ecosystem**: the community contributes plugins, skills, MCP servers, orchestrators, aggregators, and UIs.

This list collects the best of that ecosystem. Contributions welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing).

> **Tip for authors:** DeepSeek asks plugin repositories to carry the **`#dsh`** GitHub topic so they can be discovered. Add it to your repo, then open a PR here.

![DeepSeek Harness ecosystem map](./assets/dsh-ecosystem.svg)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the DSH Web UI
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web

# Install a community plugin (from this list) into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:owner/repo#main"
```

Before installing, confirm the target repo carries the **`#dsh`** GitHub topic so the community hub can index it.

## Profiles & Patch Layers

_DSH's core composition mechanism: a **profile** stacks bundle patch layers, then your own `cordis.patch.yml` (profile-level, then `$DSH_HOME`-level, then `--patch` overlays) — letting you reshape the whole plugin tree without forking. This is the layer where **task-specialized runtime configurations** live: a long-horizon profile, a math-reasoning profile, a slides-editing profile are all just a different bundle stack + patch, not a different codebase. Tools and harnesses that operate at this layer (share/export a profile, or run DSH as a specialized backend under a task-specific patch) belong here rather than under generic plugins._
